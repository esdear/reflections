How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it allows you to see what has changed in the code which led to any new bug


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    quickly accessing back versions where there were no known or future bugs for
comparison will allow much easier resolution of problems


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    manual allows you complete control, knowledge of the specific versions, and
it allows committing at logical points, but requires you to remember to do it and
take the time.  Auto will take care of it for you so you do not forget but may
not do it at the best times/create too many versions, your code may not compile,
and it may also can save changes you dont want


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because in some cases multiple files are interrelated - as in a program may
run off of several different files, which all or some of may be changed from
version to version and it is easier to track that together than have to manually
find commits made to different files at the same time


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will give you a list of every single commit made in the repository
with comments added for each one.  then git diff allows you to see the specific
changes made by comparing two files


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    knowing that you can revert will allow you to make any changes you want
with peace of mind


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    for doing everything and getting used to terminal commands
